                    <p class=\"calibre8\">A wedding was conducted in front of Sri Sankararameswarar Temple, popularly
                        known as Sivan Temple, in Thoothukudi on Thursday, after Hindu Religious and Charitable
                        Endowments Department officials denied permission to hold the ceremony inside the shrine as the
                        bride’s name was Antony Divya.</p>
                    <p class=\"calibre8\">K. Kannan of Panaiyoor near Kulathur and M. Antony Divya of Tharuvaikulam got
                        engaged recently and their wedding was slated to be held on March 7 at Sri Sankararameswarar
                        Temple.</p>
                    <p class=\"calibre8\">When the bride’s parents had submitted documents to the temple authorities for
                        the conduct of the wedding at the temple some days ago, the officials and the priests told the
                        bride’s father, Murugan, that the wedding could not be conducted in the temple as the bride had
                        the Christian name ‘Antony’.</p>
                    <p class=\"calibre8\">Even though some of the documents submitted by Mr. Murugan showed that Divya
                        was a Hindu, her school certificates reportedly certified her as Christian. The temple
                        authorities had reportedly told the parents that the wedding could be conducted at the temple
                        only if the parents of the bride submitted documents establishing that she was a Hindu. However,
                        Mr. Murugan reportedly did not submit the documents.</p>
                    <p class=\"calibre8\">When the families of the bridegroom and the bride came to the temple around 11
                        a.m. on Thursday for the wedding, the temple authorities denied entry into the temple.
                        Eventually, the families conducted the wedding in front of the temple.</p>
