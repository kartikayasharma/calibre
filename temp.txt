        "content": "Weeks before the Lok Sabha election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced a reduction in domestic LPG prices by ₹100 a cylinder.\n“This will significantly ease the financial burden on millions of households across the country, especially benefiting our \nNari Shakti\n. By making cooking gas more affordable, we also aim to support the well-being of families and ensure a healthier environment,” Mr. Modi said on X, adding that the announcement was being made on the occasion of International Women’s Day.\nThis is the second reduction in cooking gas prices in six months. Rates were cut by ₹200 per cylinder in late August ahead of the Assembly elections in five States.\nThat revision brought down the price from a nine-year high of ₹1,103 per 14.2-kg cylinder to ₹903. With Friday’s cut, an LPG cylinder will cost ₹803.\nCongress leader Randeep Surjewala called the announcement an “election gimmick”.\n“The Congress-UPA government used to buy LPG at the international price, which was 28% more than the current price, but gave it to people at less than half the price by giving huge subsidies,” he said in a post on X."

So, let us deal with this in a way that brings in all departments, ministries to work out a strategy to reduce human costs, and specifically costs to women,” Ms. Ghosh said.\n‘Recognise work’\nStressing the need for States and societies to listen to women at the forefront of climate adversities, Ms. Ghosh also said there are five ‘R’ that are important.\n“Recognise the [unpaid] work and the role women are playing in climate adaptation in terms of the increased care work they are doing. Reduce adverse impacts of climate and burden of unpaid work. Redistribute unpaid work within families. [Financially] reward unpaid workers,” she said, adding that it is also critical to represent women’s interests and needs at a policy level while taking into consideration the intersectionalities of caste and class. The photo exhibition showcased the lives of women in Ennore, where recent incidents of oil spill and ammonia leak disrupted local livelihoods, and those near the coal mines of Neyveli.

Higher law enforcing forces and enforcement agencies should instruct their subordinates accordingly.\nIn police circles, it is common to prefix sobriquets to the name of an accused in whose names history-sheets are opened. These nicknames are usually based on their appearance and physical features.\nThe First Additional Sessions Judge, D. Lingeswaran, issued an order to the law enforcement agencies, including the police, not to give such monikers, while delivering a judgment in a criminal case booked by the police.\nThe case of the prosecution is that on July 14, 2022 , D.Saravanan, 27, of Choolaimedu, robbed Vasanthakumar of ₹1,100, at knife point.\nA Sub-Inspector of police and two other constables caught Saravanan and handed him over to the Arumbakkam Police. The Police also used the prefix ‘\nKurangu\n’ (monkey), before Saravanan’s name in the first information report. The charge-sheet was filed only after seven months and the trial commenced in February, this year.\nCharges not proven\nThe judge, after hearing witnesses and perusing evidence, held that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.\nMr. Lingeswaran said the police had used a derogatory moniker ‘\nKurangu\n’, to refer to the accused, Saravanan. Every individual, regardless of their circumstances, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. “In legal proceedings, it is essential to maintain neutrality and fairness. Using derogatory names can prejudice the perception of the accused and may affect the impartiality of the legal process. Assigning derogatory names violates the human rights of the accused, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the right to a fair trial. Law enforcement agencies and legal professionals are expected to adhere to ethical standards, including treating individuals with professionalism and courtesy,” the judge said."

        "content": "Suspects in heinous crimes cannot avoid police custody hereafter by surrendering before judicial magistrates in faraway districts and notorious criminals cannot follow the \nmodus operandi\n of making unconnected individuals surrender before such magistrates to divert investigation, thanks to the Madras High Court.\nThe court on Friday ordered that, henceforth, all judicial magistrates in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry should not remand in judicial custody persons who surrender in connection with criminal cases investigated in police stations outside the territorial jurisdiction of those magistrates.\nJustice N. Anand Venkatesh held such practice, in vogue for decades together, as illegal. He said that the magistrates could invoke their power to remand under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure only when the suspects are produced by the police, and not when they surrender.\n“In the event of an accused appearing voluntarily before a Magistrate having no jurisdiction to try the case, it would be open to the Magistrate to direct the Station House Officer of the nearest police station under his jurisdiction to take the accused into custody and deal with him in accordance with the Police Standing Orders,” he said.\nThe Police Standing Orders empower such Station House Officer to arrest the suspect, if the offence was of a serious nature and there was an apprehension of him absconding, and produce him before the jurisdictional magistrate with due intimation to the police station where the investigation was pending.\nThe judge made it clear that the directions issued by him to the magistrates, with respect to voluntary surrender, would apply only to cases booked under the Indian Penal Code and not under special laws such as the Customs Act, 1962 and Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 since those procedures were different.\nOrdering the judicial magistrates in the State and the Union Territory to follow his directions scrupulously, Justice Venkatesh directed the High Court’s Registrar General to place his order before Chief Justice Sanjay V. Gangapurwala and circulate it to all judicial officers after due approval.\nThe judge dealt with the entire issue at the instance of State Public Prosecutor (SPP) Hasan Mohamed Jinnah who represented Tambaram Police Commissionerate and highlighted how effective investigation in heinous crimes was being thwarted by practice of surrendering before unconnected magistrates.\nThe SPP said that the Otteri police, under Tambaram Commissionerate, had registered a case on February 29 in connection with the murder of DMK functionary and Kattankulathur Panchayat Union deputy chairman V.S. Aramudhan in Chengalpattu district by chopping off his limbs after hurling a countrymade bomb.\nThe complainant had stated that six henchmen had committed the crime and that he would be able to identify them. Even as the police were trying to nab them, some five individuals, including a juvenile, had surrendered before the Sathyamangalam Magistrate in Erode district on March 1. The Magistrate too had remanded four of the adults in judicial custody without intimation to the investigating officer, the SPP said. He pointed out that four more individuals appeared to have surrendered in connection with the same case in Virudhunagar district.\nStating this was a common practice adopted by criminals in most cases, Mr. Jinnah requested the court to lay down guidelines and prevent the practice of judicial magistrates accepting surrender of suspects wanted by the police outside the jurisdiction of those judicial officers.\nThough Madras High Court Advocates Association president G. Mohanakrishnan requested the court not to disturb the practice in vogue for decades, the judge rejected the plea."

The marine-watchers have been trained by specialised forces such as the Indian Coast Guard, the Navy, and the Marine Police, the release added.\nSubrat Mohapatra, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of Forest Force); Srinivas R. Reddy, Chief Wildlife Warden; V. Naganathan, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife); and Bakan Jagdish Sudhakar, Wildlife Warden, Ramanathapuram, were present during the inauguration."

Palaniswami said on Friday that his party would organise a ‘human chain’ agitation across Tamil Nadu on March 12 to highlight the drug menace.\nTalking to journalists here, he demanded that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin explain his stand categorically on the matter and the alleged involvement of the expelled DMK NRI wing office-bearer Jaffer Sadiq. There were reports of 26 cases having been filed against Mr. Sadiq. Yet, he was said to have received a memento from DGP Shankar Jiwal and met Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and Minister for Sports Development Udhayanidhi Stalin, he said, seeking a thorough probe into the matter.\nReferring to the seizure of drugs in the last one month, he said the State had become a “storehouse” for drugs. Instead of the Chief Minister explaining the situation, DMK organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi had issued a statement for the sake of it.\nMr. Palaniswami, who earlier cut a 76-kg cake at the party headquarters as part of Women’s Day celebrations, said that under the DMK regime, journalists were unable to “function freely” and they should be provided protection. Only then would they be able to function effectively, he added.\nOn the DGP’s reported observation that Tamil Nadu fared better than other States in the prevalence of drugs, he retorted that this was not an issue that merited a comparison. Comparison could be made only with respect to development schemes.\nAsked about reports that the BJP was still interested in having a tie-up with the AIADMK, Mr. Palaniswami reiterated that his party stuck to the decision, taken in September last, to pull out of the alliance with the BJP.\nAsked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praise for AIADMK leaders M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa, he said Mr. Modi had highlighted the good deeds of the deceased leaders."

No arrests have been made so far.\n“These traffickers have been operating as an organised network and were luring Indian nationals through social media channels like YouTube, etc. and also through their local contacts/agents for highly-paid jobs in Russia. Thereafter, the trafficked Indian nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in the Russia-Ukraine war zone against their wishes, thus, putting their lives in grave danger.

While one Bench has called for a “neutral mechanism” to sift through cases to check if hidden political vendettas and one-upmanship were at play between the Centre and States, another Bench led by Justice Bela Trivedi prioritised the investigating agency, making it clear that States had no choice but comply with the summons of the ED.\nThe Bench led by Justice Trivedi, while directing four District Collectors in Tamil Nadu to abide by the ED summons in the sand mining case, found the State’s intervention to protect the officials both “strange and unusual”. Justice Trivedi even remarked that the Tamil Nadu government was making “an unnecessary issue out of nothing”.\nThis came when the Madras High Court had recorded a \nprima facie\n finding that the agency had no jurisdiction to summon the officials. The High Court had summed up ED’s summons as “just an attempt to investigate the possibility of identifying any proceeds of crime as a result of any criminal activity, which is not so far registered by the State agencies”.\nThe States claim that the actions of the ED, often in cases in which the predicate offence is not a scheduled offence under the PMLA, violate the principles of federalism.\nIn January, a top court Bench led by Justice Surya Kant suggested a “fair and transparent” mechanism or body to “look into the inter-State ramifications, especially when different parties are at the Centre and States, and keep intact the object of punishing the guilty while preventing vindictive arrests”.\nIn this case, the ED had approached the top court against the arrest of its officer, Ankit Tiwari, by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption in a bribe case. Several ED raids and searches across the State had preceded Mr. Tiwari’s arrest.\nAgain, in May last year, a Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice (now retired) Sanjay Kishan Kaul had warned the ED against creating an “atmosphere of fear”.\nThe top court was dealing with a petition filed by the earlier Congress government led by Bhupesh Bhagel in Chhattisgarh, who alleged that the ED was “running amok” to “implicate” the Chief Minister in a money laundering case linked to a ₹2,000-crore liquor scam.\nThere are also cases in which the Supreme Court has plainly refused to intervene.\nWhen former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren moved the Supreme Court challenging his arrest on money laundering charges in a land scam case, a Bench led by Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked him to approach the State High Court.\nThe court did not heed arguments by his lawyers that the Supreme Court had concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court.\nThe Supreme Court trimmed ED’s wings when it dismissed PMLA proceedings against Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K.

In the video, he can be seen stepping on the prayer mat used by the devotees, and shouting at the men to leave the area.\nRoad blockade\nAfter the incident, Inderlok residents blocked the road and demanded action against Mr. Tomar, who is a police post in-charge. Security was beefed up in the area to maintain law and order. Paramilitary forces have also been deployed.\nAmid the tension, protesters blocked the roads, preventing vehicular movement. The incident took place just a few days ahead of the month of Ramzan.\nJoint Commissioner of Police (Central Range) Parmaditya and Additional Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Sagar Singh Kalsi also reached the spot to diffuse the situation."

Mr. Tobgay had lost during a primary vote in 2018 but won with a massive majority in general elections held on January 9.

Give them petty cash in the form of unemployment allowance. What we are promising is making our youth employable, by giving them on-the-job training. This provides them an income, which they have earned with dignity,” All India Professionals’ Congress chairpersonPraveen Chakravarty, among the key members of the Opposition party’s manifesto committee, explained. He further argued thatthis will benefit the business which will get labour at reduced cost since the government will share the cost of the stipend and they will get skilled workers.\nMr. Chakravarty said the scheme will be extended to 20 lakh youth. Asked, whether the Congress’s estimate is too low, Mr. Chakravarty said, “It is like MNREGA, once we unroll the scheme we will know the demand. Even if it is more than 20 lakh there are 10 lakh private businesses that as per the GST data who have a revenue of more than ₹5 crore annually can afford to participate in the programme.”\nThis idea, Mr. Chakravarty said, came after consultations with more than two dozen economists and policy experts across the world. It also existed in the form of the Apprenticeship Act, 1962 which mandates firms to hire apprentices and as of date, 45,000 companies are enrolled under the law. “The voluntary apprenticeship programme is successfully running in many Scandinavian countries and Germany. But ours is unique because it makes it a right, just like we brought in MNREGA,” he added.\nTo take the idea to the young electorate and the first-time voters, the party has mandated the Youth Congress to deliver guarantee cards across the country."

It is the same Bench which struck down the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional in a unanimous verdict on February 15.\nThe verdict had directed the bank, which was authorised to transact under the scheme, to submit full details of bonds to the Election Commission (EC) by March 6. The EC was in turn ordered to publish the information on its website by March 13.\nHowever, the bank had filed a nine-page application in the Supreme Court on March 4, just two days before the deadline.

While the payment gateway is now working and applications are going through, the accepted methods have been limited to Net banking and credit or debit cards, even though Razorpay typically offers most digital payment methods on other sites it serves; at least one major bank, the State Bank of India, is not a listed option for Net banking. \nThe Hindu\n has reached out to the EC and Razorpay for comment.\nError message\nAs for the government’s RTI online portal, users have been able to log in to the portal and file fresh applications, but cannot see lists of applications they have filed from the website — to view status of an application, applicants have to retrieve the filing number manually and view its status. An error on the site claims that there is ongoing “emergency maintenance” that will last for a “few minutes”. The error has persisted for almost a week.\nThe Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), under the Home Ministry, runs the RTI Online portal. The DoPT did not respond to queries by \nThe Hindu\n. A technical support agent for the website said they had no information on the cause of the current downtime, and that the issue may take upwards of 15 days to resolve. Public authorities continue to be able to access the government side of the portal and process applications, a Public Information Officer working with a government body told \nThe Hindu\n.\nThe RTI portals maintained by different governments have had a spotty record in the past few years. In August 2023, data of applications before 2022 went missing from the portal without explanation. The DoPT restored that data after \nThe Hindu\n’s report on the change, and added a message that “[t]o make the RTI online portal faster, archival mechanism has been implemented.” The site has faced speed and availability issues at different instances over the years.\nThe Telangana RTI portal had gone down that same month, as officials said that “essential training” for government officers to use the portal was still under way.\nThe site was down again in February and was restored after the Bharat Rashtra Samithi highlighted the issue on X."

        "content": "The Union government has tweaked the new ₹75,000-crore PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana (rooftop solar: free electricity scheme). From an initial plan to fully subsidise the installation of 1 kW-3 kW solar systems in one crore households via tie-ups with renewable energy service companies, the scheme will now only contribute up to 60% of the costs, \nThe Hindu\n has learnt.\nHouseholds interested in availing the scheme’s benefits will have to fork out the balance amount and pay a minimum of ₹20,000 depending on the power capacity of the installed system though this could be defrayed by a low-interest, collateral-free loan.\nOnly houses with a suitable roof and an existing connection to the grid will be eligible for the scheme and consumers still have to pay for all the net power supplied and consumed via the grid. “The free component in this, is in the sense, that it will reduce your electricity bill. You will get a payback and that can range from three to seven years. Whatever capital cost [is invested by consumer] will be recovered in three to five years and after that it could mean even income,” Bhupinder Bhalla, Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the nodal body coordinating the scheme, told \nThe Hindu\n on Friday.\nThrough a system of net-metering, any solar power produced in a household and unused will flow back into the grid and will be offset in the household’s electricity bill. Depending on consumption patterns, this could even mean consumers earning money, though the general experience, the world over, shows a reduction in bills.\nPower Minister R.K. Singh had explained the financing of the scheme differently in an interaction with reporters on February 3.\nHe had said that public sector units, affiliated to the Power Ministry, would be reaching out to “eligible” households and installing the rooftop solar systems for free.\n“Sixty per cent of the cost of installation will be subsidised by the Centre. For the rest, [a Central] Public Sector Enterprise will take a loan [from a bank] and will repay from the cost of electricity [used by the household] over and above the 300 units. You as a householder pay nothing,” he had said.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget Speech had first mentioned the scheme envisaged to generate up to 300 units of free electricity every month.\nMr. Bhalla clarified that the while there would be an “option” for having service companies provide solar installations, the “focus” of the scheme had shifted towards consumers taking loans and getting installations.\nThe major difference from previous versions of the scheme is a doubling of the subsidy on rooftop solar (from an earlier ₹14,500 per kW) and an anticipated improvement in service delivery. “We have learnt from past mistakes. There are 4,300 vendors and a convenient system for a household to apply online and get it installed,” reckoned Mr. Bhalla. “Unlike in the past you don’t have to run around to get an installation.”\nAs the scheme is now envisaged, 12 public sector banks will offer a collateral free loan (1% above the current prevailing RBI repo rate, now 6.5%) to anyone with a viable roof and grid connectivity and wanting to install a rooftop system. A 3 kW-hour system can generate up to 300 units a month, depending on available sunshine and for this a maximum subsidy of up to ₹78,000 will be available.\nCurrently a rooftop solar system costs about ₹50,000 per kW. A householder can either pay the balance or take a loan. A vendor will appraise the site and then install the system along with an inverter and a smart meter that can switch between grid and solar supply. Operation and maintenance costs up to five years will be factored into the cost.\n“We already have 40 lakh registrations and some installations are already under way in Gujarat. We expect to reach the target of one crore houses in three years,” he added."

        "title": "India’s suboptimal use of its labour power",
        "content": "A vast majority of Indians earn the entirety of their incomes through labour as opposed to ownership of capital or land. Further, about 90% of the working Indian population earns its livelihood through informal employment that is characterised by little or no job security, no employment benefits, no social protection, and lower earnings. The informally employed are primarily concentrated among casual labourers and the self-employed, but exist even in some segments of those who are classified as regular wage or salaried workers.\nTherefore, whatever is happening to the GDP growth rate — which tends to occupy the headlines concerning the economy — or how that translates into improvements in the standards of living of the masses, in the end, depends on what is happening to the labour market — are new jobs being created? Are better jobs being created? Are wages going up?\nA deeper reading of improvements\nAt first glance it would seem that things have improved in the recent past for which we have yearly data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), beginning 2017-18, which replaced the earlier periodic National Sample Survey (Employment-Unemployment). Overall, the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) has gone up steadily to 58.35% in 2021-22, starting at 52.35% in 2017-18, a trend that is being driven largely by women in rural areas. This goes against the long-term trend towards decreasing LFPR over several decades since liberalisation. Moreover, the overall unemployment rate has also declined from 6.2% in 2017-18 to 4.2% in 2021-22. For the youth, the unemployment rate numbers are higher (12% in 2017-18 to 8.5% in 2021-22) but display the same downward trend. For both the LFPR and the unemployment rate, the very latest data available for 2022-23, display the same trajectory.\nDo these improvements signal dynamism in the labour market in terms of job creation and wage growth? What is happening to the composition of the jobs and the earnings? In a recent essay with Jitendra Singh of Ashoka University, we looked at this question carefully, comparing the trends over the more recent period with longer-run trends.\nWhen we look at the different categories of the employed, namely, regular wage/salaried work, casual work, and self-employment and their trends, we can see that the improvements in LFPR and the drop in the unemployment rate are largely driven by self-employment. The self-employed come in three categories — own-account workers, unpaid family workers, and employers who employ outside labour. A disturbing trend emerges if we look at them separately to identify which subcategory explains the overall rise in the self-employed. While the fraction of the self-employed who are employers has gone up marginally by less than one percentage point from 3.78% in 2017-18 to 4.57% in 2021-22, the bulk of the growth in self-employment has come from the rise of unpaid family workers, which has increased from 26% to 31.4% over the period.\nThough the absolute number of workers in each employment type is increasing over the period of study, within the employed pool, the sharpest rise is seen in the proportion of unpaid family labour such as a helper in the family-run \nkirana \nstore. Further, own-account workers such as someone running a corner shop or selling tea and snacks on a cart constitute the largest chunk of the employed population at close to 35%. The proportion of other subcategories within the employed (regular wage/salaried employee, casual labour, employer, and own-account worker) has dropped between 2017-18 and 2021-22. Together, this reflects a worsening of the quality of work being done by the workforce. Given that the seeming dynamism in the labour market has come from a subcategory of the self-employed — a category which itself is considered to be a main component of informal employment and, therefore, precarious in nature — it is cause for worry.\nIn terms of earnings\nDoes the evidence from earnings allay some of these worries? Unfortunately, the state of the labour market does not appear to fare well in terms of earnings too. At the most aggregate level, the all-India average real daily earnings increased by around ₹10 (in 2010 prices) between 2017-18 and 2021-22, about a 4% increase. Both rural and urban daily earnings increased on an average between ₹10 to ₹14 (in 2010 prices). However, this overall increase was not uniform for workers in all employment types. In general, the average earnings of wage and salaried workers are the highest among different categories of workers, followed by the self-employed and then the casual workers. The average daily earnings for both the salaried and the self-employed stagnated over the period, showing no increase in real terms. However, those in casual work saw an increase from ₹162 a day in 2017-18 to ₹196 a day in 2021-22, which is about a 20% increase; this is the category that is responsible for the moderate increase in the overall average earnings of the employed. While this is a positive development, we must put it in context: even with a 30-day work month, casual workers were making ₹6,000 a month at 2010 prices (or, ₹11,520 in 2021 prices). Note that this is barely above the poverty line of ₹4,080 a month in rural areas and ₹5,000 a month in urban areas (poverty lines in 2011-12 prices).\nTo sum up our findings, while the rise in the LFPR and fall in the unemployment rate since 2017-18 appears to be a positive sign, closer examination suggests that the self-employed category of work saw the highest growth in employment generation between 2017-18 and 2021-22. And within that, it was the subcategory of unpaid family workers which saw the most growth in numbers. Not surprisingly, the earnings for the self-employed did not record any discernible improvements. The most desirable category of the employed (regular wage and salaried workers) did not see any real increase either in its share in total employment or in average earnings. In fact, the top 20% of salaried workers saw a drop in their real daily average earnings over the period. Though casual workers as a category saw a slight decrease in its share of total employment, their average earnings experienced moderate growth.\nPhase of demographic dividend\nWhile this is a matter of concern from the welfare perspective (i.e., how is economic growth affecting the job prospects and earnings in the labour market?) it also has larger macroeconomic growth repercussions. Taken together, own-account workers, casual workers, and unpaid family workers form more than three quarters of the employed. That is to say, more than three quarters of our working population is engaged in work which is typically of low productivity.\nTo put it in context, India is in its period of demographic dividend which is expected to peak in less than 20 years and exhaust in roughly another 30 to 35 years. In this golden period of reaping labour productivity, the economy continues to utilise its labour capital in a suboptimal fashion by engaging a majority in low quality work. Moreover, given that the poorer sections tend to spend a greater fraction of their incomes, their stagnant earnings also do not augur well for the demand-side of the economy coming from consumer expenditure, given that the investment to GDP ratio has been steadily declining — thereby raising the spectre of a vicious cycle."

        "title": "Gender equality as the plank of sustainable development",
        "content": "Conversations around gender equality and women’s empowerment continue to gain momentum. We, however, would like to reflect on an issue that is often overlooked, which is the critical intersection between gender equality and sustainable energy development. Time and again, studies have proven that gender equality and women’s empowerment are fundamental to achieving sustainable energy for all. The achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is in one way or another dependent on gender equality. In fact, strong connections exist among SDG5 on gender equality, SDG7 on clean, affordable energy, and SDG12 on climate action, among many others.\nGender equality is not just a matter of social justice; it is also a prerequisite for sustainable development. Women play a crucial role in energy access, production, and consumption. Yet, they often face significant barriers that limit their participation and impact in the energy sector. This gender disparity not only hampers individual opportunities but also hinders overall economic growth and environmental sustainability.\nGender equality in energy access\nIn many parts of the world, women bear primary responsibility for household energy management that includes cooking, heating, and lighting. However, research has shown that energy infrastructure tends to reach women last, yet the lack of access to modern energy affects women and children disproportionately. For example, lack of access to clean and reliable energy sources, forces women to rely on traditional and harmful alternatives such as biomass and kerosene. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), household air pollution leads to a staggering 3.2 million premature deaths each year — nearly half of all air pollution-related deaths — 60% of which are women and children. This not only perpetuates energy poverty but also exposes women and their families to health risks associated with household air pollution.\nAnother aspect that is particularly worrying is that the energy sector remains one of the least gender-diverse sectors. Women represent 32% of full-time employees in the renewable energy sector and only 22% in the energy sector overall; this is in comparison to 48% of women workers in the global labour force. In India, for example, only 10% of women hold technical posts in the energy sector, as per the International Energy Agency (IEA). This gender disparity is fuelled by disparities in educational access, restricted opportunities for women to acquire technical skills and training, and inequitable company policies, among other contributing factors.\nBridging the gender gap\nTackling these challenges requires a change in perception towards women’s role in the energy sector and concerted efforts to mainstream gender in energy policies at the sub-national, national and international levels. Governments, non-state actors, international institutions and philanthropic organisations have a critical role to play in providing an enabling environment, innovative solutions and transformative platforms to not only increase access to clean energy but also deliver groundbreaking solutions to promote women’s meaningful participation in the sustainable energy transition.\nInitiatives such as the Women at the Forefront programme and the Energy Transitions Innovation Challenge (ENTICE) provide a forum for individuals, especially women, to embark on entrepreneurial ventures and drive collective action for sustainable energy practices.\nWe also see an opportunity for Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE), which are already being deployed by various State governments in India in collaboration with philanthropic organisations, to quickly provide affordable energy access and reduce the everyday drudgery of women’s work, thereby increasing their productivity. Solar Mamas is one inspirational initiative started in India by Barefoot College to train illiterate women to become solar engineers, bringing clean power and light to their communities.\nIt is evident that empowering women in the energy sector is not just the right thing to do. It is also a smart investment in our collective future. Studies have shown that closing the gender gap in employment and entrepreneurship could boost global GDP by trillions of dollars.\nSimilarly, increasing women’s participation in the energy sector can lead to more innovative solutions, increased productivity, and enhanced social and environmental outcomes. A recent report conducted by Powering Livelihoods has indicated that more than 71% of the early adopters of clean technology livelihood appliances in India, totalling over 16,000, are women.\nWith the passage of International Women’s Day, it is important to recognise that the dialogue on gender and energy has clearly shifted from women being identified as part of vulnerable groups to acknowledging them as key agents of change, as consumers, producers, distributors and decision makers across the energy sector.\nGender-responsive and women-led initiatives have been successful in the clean energy space. That is why, this is the right time to harness the power of women and energy to create a more inclusive, prosperous, and sustainable world for present and future generations."

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi painted a rosy picture of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) during his first visit to the Union Territory that was formed by the bifurcation of the erstwhile State, and also stripped of its special constitutional status, in 2019. Mr. Modi’s speech, on March 7, at a rally in Srinagar and his interaction with local entrepreneurs who have benefited from central schemes, were efforts to win hearts. While Mr. Modi positioned the impressive attendance at his rally as an endorsement of the government’s integrationist approach in the last five years, the Opposition parties have said that at least a part of the attendees were brought there by the administration. The Prime Minister was also addressing the electorate outside of J&K just ahead of the Lok Sabha election. He steered clear of any political outreach and, instead, catalogued the achievements of his government in creating more opportunities for the people. Kashmiris were “breathing free now”, the Prime Minister said. Mr. Modi also trained his guns on the Congress and the two regional parties, the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for “ruining” J&K for seven decades through “self-centric dynastic politics”.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has always seen Kashmir as an example of the Indian state’s indecisiveness that it pledged to reverse. The Prime Minister’s speech underlined this perspective of Kashmir as a developmental and management challenge rather than a question of political and cultural federalism. Mr. Modi also urged rich Indians to plan their weddings in Kashmir, asked countrymen overseas to motivate non-Indians to visit the Valley and requested domestic tourists to buy local products to boost employment opportunities in Kashmir. Development of the region may help locals, who have been wounded by decades of conflict, but the restoration of political and democratic rights that have been curtailed since 2019, is also essential. Leaders of the NC and PDP have expressed disappointment with Mr. Modi’s visit, by saying that showcasing the hollowing out of Article 370 as an achievement was akin to rubbing salt into the wounds. Though the Centre may not accept their legitimacy, these parties remain the closest approximation of public opinion in Kashmir. Restoring Statehood and conducting Assembly elections could only be the beginning of the political process in Kashmir, which continues to face multiple challenges that range from militancy to revolving-door detentions of youth. The BJP will be using its Kashmir policy in its campaigning in the run-up to the election to sway public opinion in its strongholds, but it should also pay attention to public opinion in the Valley."

        "title": "Dubious response",
        "content": "It has barely been three weeks since a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India unanimously struck down the Electoral Bond scheme as unconstitutional for violating the right to information under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The scheme, which was notified in 2018, facilitated anonymous political donations. The judgment also stipulated that the State Bank of India (SBI), the sole bank authorised to issue electoral bonds, had to immediately stop issuing them. It also had to furnish, by March 6, details of the political parties that were recipients besides the purchase details which included the date of purchase and the denomination. The intent in asking the SBI to do so was clear — to ensure transparency in political funding at a time when the general election is due. In its response, the SBI, through one of its functionaries, has sought time till the end of June 2024, which would be well after the expected date of the general election, to release data. The bank’s response is curious and difficult to accept. First, it said that it required time to reconcile two silos of information — one related to the purchase of the bonds and the other to the parties that were issued the bonds — and that it was difficult to pinpoint which political party was issued bonds by the relevant donor. This clearly was not the requirement from the top court, which has merely directed the bank to release purchase and issuing information and not to pinpoint the link between donor and recipient.\nSecond, the response suggests that only the number of bonds issued, and not the KYC details of the purchasers, has been stored digitally, complicating the process of collecting this information. But reports based on RTI queries have found that the bank was indeed storing data on the donors who were purchasing electoral bonds and their dates of purchase. Reports also indicate that the bank issued a unique alphanumeric code to each bond, which should make it relatively easy to gather details on the bonds’ issue date and the denomination quickly through database queries. While matching each donor to a party will be tricky, it should be possible to triangulate data on recipient parties and the issuing of bonds as these bonds have to be redeemed by political parties within 15 days. Information that is available in public till March 2023 shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party received 57% of all the money donated through bonds, followed by the Congress, which received close to 10%. In the hearing of the contempt petition filed against the SBI for its response, the Court must compel the bank to get its act together and furnish the information well in time before the election."

        "content": "Trigger warning: the following article has references to bullying and suicide. Please avoid reading if you feel distressed by the subject.\nO\nn February 15, J.S. Sidharthan, 21, a second-year undergraduate student at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University at Pookode village in Wayanad district of northern Kerala, abruptly left campus. He informed his classmates that he was feeling unwell and wanted to go home to Nedumangad, a town located about 430 kilometres away in Thiruvananthapuram district in the south. But he told his parents that he was coming home to attend two temple festivals. No one knows which of these stories was true.\nSidharthan’s father, T. Jayaprakash, 47, a supervisor at a construction company in Dubai, recalls the conversations that his wife Sheeba had with their son. “When she called him, Sidharthan had reached Ernakulam (in central Kerala). Then he suddenly told her that he was returning to Pookode as he had to submit a certificate. He went back to university the next day,” he says.\nWhen Sheeba tried to call her son later, he didn’t pick up the phone, says Jayaprakash. “When he finally did, he told her that he was lying down and would call later.”\nTwo days later, Jayaprakash received a call from a postgraduate student of the university. He recalls how he froze when he was informed that Sidharthan had been in an accident and was seriously injured. The next day, Jayaprakash flew home from Dubai. But Sidharthan was no more. Jayaprakash was shocked to learn that his son had not been in an accident; instead, he had been found dead in the washroom of the men’s hostel in a case of suspected death by suicide. He says he and Sheeba had no idea that their son had any problems.\nSiddharthan’s body was brought to Nedumangad on February 20 after the post mortem. His uncle, M. Shibu, says the cremation was held a couple of hours later at their ancestral home nearby. The death of Sidharthan, who the police say had been bullied and tortured mercilessly, led to an uproar. Angry students staged a protest, which turned violent. The police, who were called in to disperse the protesters, used water cannons and tear gas. The fact that some of the accused in the case are members of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which leads the ruling Left Front government in Kerala, has created a political firesto\nrm.\nAffectionately called Sidhan\nThe 100-acre Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, which was established in December 2004, has a scenic campus. Its low-rise red and white buildings are surrounded by lawns. Many of its structures have roofs of terracotta, which is typical of this region. The centre of the campus provides panoramic views of the surrounding hillocks. But since the tragic incident and its aftermath, police personnel stand everywhere, keeping vigil. After the students’ agitation turned violent, the authorities decided to close the campus from March 4 to March 14.\nThe walls of the back alleys of the two-storey men’s hostel are covered with graffiti in bright, popping colours. In Sidharthan’s four-bed dormitory, colourful sketches, scrawls, and Malayalam verses cover the walls. Four metal beds and old storage shelves occupy the room. The windows are covered by glass and offer a partial view of a hillock. Portraits of Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx hang above the window. On occasion, the eerie silence is broken by the echo of police boots stomping through the corridors.\nThere were 105 students in Sidharthan’s batch. M. Archana, his classmate from Wayanad, says the issue leading to his death occurred near the Department of Livestock Production Management on February 12.\n“He came to the spot at night with a few others to make some final arrangements for Valentine’s Day celebrations. The situation turned tense when one of the women told a few of her male friends about Sidharthan’s suspected sexual misbehaviour,” she says.\nArchana recalls her last conversation with Sidharthan. “On February 15, he told us that he was going home since he was unwell and wanted to meet his mother. We had a sports meet on February 16 and 17 and we did not see him anywhere on campus. I got the shocking news on February 18 when I was at home,” she says, shuddering as she remembers that precise moment.\n“We called him Sidhan,” she continues. “He was lively and had a passion for wildlife photography. We don’t know what really happened to him. The media, the police, and the local people have all given us contradictory narratives.”\nThe gravity of assault\nThe police found in their preliminary investigation that Sidharthan was bullied for about three days and even paraded around naked for allegedly misbehaving with a classmate. But they are awaiting the results of scientific examinations to ascertain the cause of death.\nThe protesters allege that Sidharthan was murdered. He was found in a seven foot-high dingy washroom, but the premises have not been sealed off yet.\nThe anti-ragging cell claims it was clueless about the public trial and torture and maintains that there was no written complaint. But the composition of the cell itself is under scrutiny: a few college union leaders, suspected of being involved in the incident, are part of the cell.\nThe post-mortem findings of February 19 have brought to light evidence of assault. The post-mortem report, signed by Dr. Ajith Palekkara, Assistant Surgeon (Forensic Medicine), concludes that this was a case of “death due to hanging”. It states that there were multiple blunt injuries on Sidharthan’s body. These included two-three-day-old tramline contusions, which are caused by objects such as canes, wires, and batons.\nThe report lists out 18 specific findings indicating the gravity of assault: bluish, red, and brown aberrations and contusions of varying size all over the body; ante-mortem injuries including a scalp contusion on the back of the head; and even signs of starvation. His stomach contained only a thin film of brownish watery fluid along with a few black particles, says the report. The samples have been preserved, labelled, and sealed for chemical analysis and histopathological examination.\nThe police remand report, which came out about five days ago, states that Sidharthan, who left campus to go home on February 15, was called back by the accused to settle scores as per “hostel law”. The report mentions the role of Sinjo Johnson, one of the 18 arrested, who took him to rooms 18, 21, and 36 to repeatedly assault him on February 16 and 17, and says that “the torture abetted the suicide”. As per the remand report, the suspects possessed cable wires and belts.\nSources in the police say that Johnson has been identified as the ‘gang leader’ who reportedly oversaw the public trial and assault. Along with him, SFI leaders and a few college union functionaries have been nabbed on charges of abetting “suicide, assault, and ragging” under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The suspects have reportedly confessed to the crime and have divulged the methods that they used for torture at various locations on campus.\nKSU versus SFI\n“This is a clear case of campus murder by people who are closely associated with the SFI,” says M.J. Yadhukrishnan, State vice president of the Kerala Students’ Union (KSU). “Four of the 18 people who were arrested in connection with the incident are SFI functionaries. They tortured Sidharthan in the name of an alleged sexual assault and caused his death after a primitive campus trial.”\nFollowing the incident, the KSU organised protests that turned violent. It has also demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). It alleges that the dean, M.K. Narayanan, who was also the hostel warden, and the assistant hostel warden, R. Kanthanadhan, were lax in preventing Sidharthan’s ordeal. After the death became a political issue, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan suspended the vice chancellor of the university, M.R. Saseendranath, on March 2. The officiating vice chancellor, P.C. Saseendran, suspended Narayanan and Kanthanadhan.\nNarayanan refused to comment on the issue. Kanthanadhan states that he is depressed and unable to speak. Saseendran says he is not authorised to speak to the media.\nThe vice president of the KSU, Ann Sebastian, and KSU State general secretaries Priyanka Philip and Gowja Vijayakumar, who kept the issue alive, are unhappy. They believe that the sections of the IPC invoked against the accused are inadequate and trivial.\n“We want a judicial or CBI inquiry and a ban on the SFI on campus. How could the authorities of the university conduct interviews to decide internal promotions when a student’s body was lying in the hospital with grave signs of torture,” asks a furious Sebastian, who, along with several others, staged a hunger strike in front of the university after the protest march on March 4.\nThe SFI and the CPI(M) say that an “untoward, non-political incident” has been politicised by their rivals in view of the general elections. The members of the Wayanad district committees of the CPI(M) and the SFI who held a meeting in front of the university on March 4 argue that right-wing organisations have been selectively targeting the four SFI workers while keeping mum on the political allegiance of the other 14.\n“We are on the defensive with all this false propaganda and these politically motivated allegations. No one is probing the root cause of the incident. The police stated in their remand report that this is a case of suicide. Despite this, we decided to suspend the membership of the four SFI workers suspected in the case,” says SFI’s Wayanad district secretary, Jishnu Shaji. He alleges that the first accused in the case is the son of an influential right-wing leader in Wayanad and that the son of a Congress leader was also involved.\nMeanwhile, students on campus are upset. After the sudden closure of the university for 10 days, some 100 of the 130 students occupying the 47 rooms of the hostel have gone home. The rest who are from other regions of Kerala or other States are clueless about what to do next.\nSanjeet Singh, a final year student from Uttar Pradesh, is anxious. “Sidharthan was a good guy. We are now in a strange mental state. Going home for 10 days is not practical, so we are forced to stay back in this facility, which is in the centre of a big storm,” he laments.\nThe progress of the probe\nSeated at his home in Vinod Nagar in Nedumangad, Jayaprakash says he is concerned about the “contradictory references in the post-mortem and remand reports”. He believes that there are efforts to portray the incident as a case of suicide and slap only trivial sections of the IPC on the accused, to aid their release. He also worries that conspiracy theories remain unchecked. This is despite the police admitting that Sidharthan had undergone torture many times on campus.\nThe family is not satisfied with the progress of the investigation. “During the first two days, we were satisfied, but after the remand report came out, we are not so sure. We fear that there are attempts to protect the accused,” Jayaprakash says.\nReferring to the sexual assault charges filed by the woman who was allegedly assaulted by Sidharthan, Jayaprakash says the complaint was filed only after his son’s death. “If my son was involved in any wrongdoing, I would be the first person to demand action. How was a complaint of this nature registered only after his death? The members of the Internal Complaints Committee are answerable,” he adds.\nAngry that the dean chose to visit them with a police escort only a week after Sidharthan’s death, Jayaprakash says, “It was February 25, I think. A special branch officer came and told me that the dean wanted to visit us and asked us whether we had any problem. I said no, I don’t have a problem. About an hour later, the dean came with the sub-inspector of Nedumangad station.” He is also furious with the university for failing to properly communicate to him the news about Sidharthan’s death.\nJayaprakash urges the vice chancellor to encourage students to give their statements in complete confidentiality. “We don’t know whether he will do this. We can only hope,” he says.\nThe grief-stricken father says Sidharthan was studious. “When he cleared NEET (National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test), we wanted him to try again and improve his ranking. But he decided to pursue veterinary science. I used to tell him, ‘Get a job fast, so I can return home,’” he says, sobbing. “He would tell me not to press him as he wanted to study more.”\nWith inputs from Tiki Rajwi\nIf you are in distress, please call this 24X7 helpline: KIRAN: 1800-5990019 or DISHA: 1056"

        "content": "Vegetarian food plate prices rose 7% in February, driven by a spurt in onion and tomato prices, even as non-vegetarian plate costs slid 9% from a year earlier, as per Crisil’s monthly report on food plate costs titled ‘Roti Rice Rate’.\nThe report, which flags trends in food price gains ahead of the official retail inflation numbers, noted that onion prices climbed 29% and tomato prices surged 38%. The prices of rice and pulses, which account for 21% of the cost of a representative home-cooked vegetarian food plate, also rose 14% and 20%, respectively.\n“The decrease in the cost of the non-vegetarian thali was due to a decline of around 20% year-on-year in broiler prices on a high base of last fiscal,” Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics said. Broiler prices account for about half of the cost of a non-vegetarian thali.\nBroiler costs\nHowever, on a sequential basis, vegetarian food plate costs dropped 2% from January levels to hit ₹27.5, their lowest level since July 2023. Non-vegetarian plates were 4% more expensive on a month-on-month basis, rising to ₹54, as broiler prices rose an estimated 10% from January due to lower supply.\nThe firm attributed this to “the spread of bird flu in Andhra Pradesh and increasing temperatures, as well as rising demand” ahead of Ramadan.\n“The cost of the veg thali eased [from January] due to a decline of 14% and 3% on-month in prices of onion and potato, respectively, while prices of tomato and pulses remained flat,” said Crisil’s analytics unit, which computes the average cost of preparing a thali based on input prices prevailing in north, south, east and west India."

        "content": "Some believe artificial intelligence (AI) could be more biased than humans as the technology may display stronger racial and gender biases than people do. How can banks, hospitals, governments, and public service bodies deploy Generative AI to run their functions globally and yet ensure fair treatment of their customers and citizens?\nWell, Teja Manakame, VP, IT India, Dell Technologies says, biases can inadvertently be introduced in the system based on the prompts used to generate results. She advises exercising caution while designing prompts to avoid such unfair bias to guard against discrimination.\nTalking to \nThe Hindu \nabout ethical AI, she said, ‘‘AI must be honest, fair, and equitable. It must avoid unfair bias and guard against prejudice, and marginalisation of vulnerable populations.” Ms. Manakame also cautioned that ‘equitable’ may not always mean ‘impartial’, and that AI systems may require human oversight or intervention to ensure equitable results.\nShe said outcomes from the use of any technology are based on how we use it. AI is just another technology without any human cognition. The system inherently does not have any bias but depends on how it is trained.\nThe outcomes will depend on how we train the models, the data sets we use, and the design of prompts etc. Hence it is crucial that the data sets used for training models are fair and cover all scenarios avoiding all possible biases, she added.\nWhen asked to comment on Elon Musk’s statement: that AI is a ‘destructive force’, she said AI is now ubiquitous in businesses of all sizes, and in consumer and residential applications.\n‘‘We see the usage of AI in every aspect of life, right from purchasing something online to self-driving vehicles. This technology makes our lives easier and enhances customer experiences. As with any technology we must leverage this to augment human intelligence and enhance our productivity,” Ms. Manakame added."

It deplored an increase in the building of new settlement homes in recent months.\n“The West Bank is already in crisis. Yet, settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian state,” UN human rights chief Volker Türk said. He presented the report to the Human Rights Council on Friday.\nReports this week that Israel plans to build nearly 3,500 settler homes in three areas “fly in the face of international law,” he said.\nMr. Türk said the creation and expansion of settlements amount to the transfer by Israel of its own population into territories that it occupies, “which amounts to a war crime under international law,” his office said in a statement.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli diplomatic mission in Geneva.\nInternational consensus\nMuch of the international community considers the settlements to be illegal under international law.\nExpanded settlement activity and an upsurge in violence in the West Bank in recent months have been largely overshadowed by bloodshed and displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israeli forces have led a blistering military campaign against the militant group Hamas following its deadly October 7 attacks in Israel."
